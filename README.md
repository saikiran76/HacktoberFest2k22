# NewsletterWebApp
Hey Fellas ! Need your attention. There are issues with the backend code for this Newsletter subscription app while I'm trying to post the the data to the MailChimp's server. Try figuring out the issue with the code by running the code using hyper (command-line) locally on port 3000 (was set default). Note : If you've no account in mailchimp, go ahead and create one. Sign-in to your account and read the documentation if you've no idea about its API instructions, or the semantics to post the data to its servers. You may create your own API key and list ID(audience ID). Backend developers gear-up and figure out the issue.   #hacktoberfest #Node.js #JS #HTML #CSS
